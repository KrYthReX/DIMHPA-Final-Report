# Bioinformatics Final Report

This repository contains the final report for our bioinformatics final group project.

## Report
You can view the detailed report [here](DIMPHA-Final-Report.pdf).

## Summary
- **Objective**: ("Analyze 4 proteins and assess the hydrogen bond altercations induced by specific single and double amino acid insertions")
- **Dataset**: ("Sequenced JSON files from Rosetta into PDB file format. Each protein had a different number of mutants, but could range from 400,000 mutants (individal PDB files) up to 1.2 million mutants.")
- **Methods**: ("Utilized Python pipeline to speed the conversion processes up, once PDBs were obtained, utilized HBPLUS, a tool that generates Hydrogen Bond information from a given PDB file. Cross referenced residue locations with PDB files to obtain coordinates.")
- **Results**: ("Results listed in report")
