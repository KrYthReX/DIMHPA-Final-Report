# CSCI474/574 Bioinformatics Final Report

This repository contains the final report for our bioinformatics final group project. This was a class offered at [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu/) in Fall 2024.

## Summary
- **Objective**: ("Analyze 4 proteins and assess the hydrogen bond altercations induced by specific single and double amino acid insertions")
[//]: #Analyzed how double insertion mutations affect hydrogen bond stability and flexibility in proteins using datasets from protein mutants (e.g., 1crn, 1hhp, 1cdz, 1csp).

- **Dataset**: ("Sequenced JSON files from Rosetta into PDB file format. Each protein had a different number of mutants, but could range from 400,000 mutants (individal PDB files) up to 1.2 million mutants.")
- **Methods**: ("Utilized Python pipeline to speed the conversion processes up, once PDBs were obtained, utilized HBPLUS, a tool that generates Hydrogen Bond information from a given PDB file. Cross referenced residue locations with PDB files to obtain coordinates.")
- **Results**: ("Results listed in report")
