    abstract = {Understanding how amino acid insertion mutations affect protein structure can inform pharmaceutical efforts targeting diseases that are caused by protein mutants. In silico simulation of mutations complements experiments performed on physical proteins which are time and cost prohibitive. We have computationally generated the exhaustive sets of two amino acid insertion mutations for five protein structures in the Protein Data Bank. To probe and identify how pairs of insertions affect structural stability and flexibility, we tally the count of hydrogen bonds and analyze a variety of metrics of each mutant. We identify hotspots where pairs of insertions have a pronounced effect, and study how amino acid properties such as size and type, and insertion into alpha helices, affect a protein’s structure. The findings show that although there are some residues, Proline and Tryptophan specifically, which if inserted have a significant impact on the protein’s structure, there is also a great deal of variance in the effects of the exhaustive insertions both for any single protein, and across the five proteins. That suggests that computational or otherwise quantitative efforts should consider large representative sample sizes especially when training models to make predictions about the effects of insertions.The data underlying this article is available at https://multimute.cs.wwu.edu.},

abstract = {Intra-molecular side-chain:main-chain (sch:mch) and side-chain (sch:sch) hydrogen bonds observed in 44 well refined crystallographic protein structures with non-homologous sequences have been identified, classified and analysed to detect recurring structural patterns. Each observed bond was characterized by the position of its acceptor and donor groups relative to the N and C termini of the particular secondary structure in which they occur and according to their appearance within the same of sequentially separated secondary structures. The role of short-range hydrogen bonds in the formation and stabilization of a secondary structure and the importance of long-range hydrogen bonds as a cohesive force for different structural segments were also examined. It was found that the N terminus of α-helices is characterized by recurring sch:mch and sch:sch bonds with elements of the preceding coil segment, while at the C terminus a frequent intra-helix sch:mch hydrogen bond was frequently observed. The residues at or near the β-strand termini often cross-linked, through hydrogen-bonding, non-sequential coil segments. Coil structures were characterized by recurring, internal sch:mch hydrogen bonding involving small polar side-chain groups situated at or near their N termini (coil N-capping). The significance of hydrogen bonds as formers and stabilizers of a protein fold and the association of its secondary structural units was also considered through an examination of bond density and distribution throughout the protein tertiary structure.}

ABSTRACT = {Activating somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are frequently implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While L858R and exon 19 deletion mutations are most prevalent, exon 20 insertions are often observed in NSCLC. Here, we investigated the structural implications of two common EGFR exon 20 insertions in NSCLC, V769insASV and D770insNPG. The active and inactive conformations of wild-type, D770insNPG and V769insASV EGFRs were probed with molecular dynamics simulations to identify local and global alterations that the mutations exert on the EGFR kinase domain, highlighting mechanisms for increased enzymatic activity. In the active conformation, the mutations increase interactions that stabilize the αC helix that is essential for EGFR activity. Moreover, the key Lys745–Glu762 salt bridge was more conserved in the insertion mutations. The mutants also preserved the state of the structurally critical aspartate–phenylalanine–glycine (DFG)-motif and regulatory spine (R-spine), which were altered in wild-type EGFR. The insertions altered the structure near the ATP-binding pocket, e.g., the P-loop, which may be a factor for the clinically observed tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) insensitivity by the insertion mutants. The inactive state simulations also showed that the insertions disrupt the Ala767–Arg776 interaction that is key for maintaining the “αC-out” inactive conformation, which could consequently fuel the transition from the inactive towards the active EGFR state.},
